# NAS-2021-data
Ministry of Education's report dashboard available here: [https://nas.gov.in/report-card/nas-2021](https://nas.gov.in/report-card/nas-2021)

The data here is organised into â€“
1. [**JSONs:**](./json_data/) These contain all the data from national, state and district reports. Might be a bit hard to parse.
2. **CSVs:** These contain _most_ of the data from the JSONs. Easier to use.

Ignore the files in the [`code`](./code/) folder. Or not.

The rights for the data belong to NCERT and DoSEL, MoE.
